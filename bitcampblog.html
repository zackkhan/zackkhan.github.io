          <p>Directing a hackathon has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life so far. Hackathons have always held a special spot for me, because they are what piqued my interest in thegot me into the entrepreneurial elementside of Computer Science. I attended to  my first hackathon, Bitcamp, as a high school senior, not at all knowing what to expect. I came away from this experience mesmerized by all the amazing things people could accomplish in just a weekend, like a pong robot!</p>
          <p>But what drew me to Bitcamp specifically was how inviting and beginner friendly it was. I was immediately drawn to the campfire theme and even as a high school senior at a college level event, I felt welcome. The following year as a UMD freshman, I joined the Bitcamp organizing team (of ~60 members) to help inspire more students, and this past year, I was the co-executive director of Bitcamp 2018. This article is a journey through the process and a few lessons I learned about motivating teams at scale.</p>
          <p><b>Leadership Styles</b></p>
          <p>I was fortunate to have co-directed Bitcamp with my friend Tim, who is an amazing person. While we got along well, Tim and I had very different leadership styles. Tim was very tactical and detail-oriented: he honed in on the logistical details, working closely with the Logistics teams to hash out details such as A/V, bugs in our registration app, etc. Meanwhile, I focused more on higher level details such as setting the overall theme, communicating with higher ups from the University, arranging speakers, etc.</p>
          <p>Tim and I also had different risk-tolerances, which balanced out well: I definitely had some crazy ideas that Tim helped ground into reality (I went to a talk over the summer with Ben Horowitz saying that the best founders are the ones that drive you crazy in the best way, and I definitely felt that between Tim and I).</p>
          <p><b>Shared Vision</b></p>
          <p>During my first year on the Bitcamp organizing team, I did not feel a strong sense of cohesion. Most of the team hadn't really interacted until the week of the event and there was no central vision tying us all together. A personal goal was to create a sense of family among the team: I strongly believe that you work best when you are surrounded with people you care deeply about, all rallied under a unifying cause.</p>
          <p>As a sophomore, I was still relatively new to the team compared to many others. I initially felt a strong desire to establish a deep connection with each member on the team, but with over 60 members, I quickly realized that that wasn't feasible. What was more important was ensuring everyone on the team had robust relationships with each other, not just me. If everyone had at least 3 good friends, then each member would have the support network they need to feel welcome.</p>
          <p>To accomplish this, I proposed Bitcamp Retreat: a weekend focused on getting to know one another and setting goals for the upcoming year. During retreat, we all gathered around the living room of our Airbnb to discuss our goals, giving everyone an opportunity to contribute. It really felt like a family meeting (and the living room environment definitely helped, with everyone sitting on a big couch). The familiar culture and goals that were set at Retreat shaped how the team executed for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p><b>Cultivating Relationships</b></p>
          <p>After the success of Retreat, Tim and I went all in on community oriented events: ramen nights, camping trips and even a New Years Card that we sent to our sponsors. With each event, I could feel the overall team morale improving and a greater sense of accountability as people did not want to let their friends on the team down.</p>
          <p><b>Culture of Feedback and Acknowledgement</b></p>
          <p>Halfway through the year, Tim and I released an anonymous feedback form regarding our performance and how the organizers felt about their experience on the team. Some key takeaways were that people did not know what was going on within other subteams, so we introduced weekly team updates during our meetings. Positive feedback is also super valuable, and fortunately, many organizers felt they were learning valuable skills and making great friends. We also began spending five minutes at the beginning of weekly meetings opening the floor for shoutouts to team members who had been a huge help over the past week.</p>
          <p><b>Sustainability</b></p>
          <p>I have seen so many great college organizations dissolve because the leaders did not consider what would happen after they graduate. We made it a point to encourage the directors to actively provide more responsibility to members of their sub-team and think about their successors. The idea of shifting responsibilities and thinking about successors so far in advance was foreign to me, but it made the transition process at the end of the year much smoother and efficient.</p>
          <p><b>Biggest Regret</b></p>
          <p>My biggest regret was getting so caught up in execution mode that I didn't devote the time to ask why. While we did make significant changes for Bitcamp 2018, I felt that I devoted so much time to keeping the ship afloat (things like ensuring we had enough money to run the event) that I had little time to think about why we did things a certain way. Ideas for reimagining the hackathon model became clear to me after the event had passed, and I really wish I had devoted time purely to reimagine Bitcamp as a new experience and not as the 5th iteration of an event. For future projects, I want to ensure that I give myself the time to break out of execution mode and start from the basics.</p>
          <p><b>Looking Ahead</b></p>
          <p>I haven't quite felt that same high as when I sat on the top bleachers of the Xfinity Center and saw over a thousand people exploring the possibilities of technology, as I did just two years ago as a high school senior. I remember at that moment, I couldn't help but get a bit sentimental, saying something along the lines of “we did this”. That high was likely the closest I have ever felt to the highs of running a startup. And there were definitely lows leading up to the event, but the highs made it all worthwhile.</p>
          <p><b>Thank You</b></p>
          <p>I would like to thank the entire Bitcamp team for teaching me so much and being amazing friends as well as teammates. Although my time at UMD is slowly wrapping up, I hope I can find a similar family to work with after graduation.</p>
