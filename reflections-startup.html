<p>I just finished my second full week working at a ~10 person startup! Here are my initial thoughts :) </p>
<p>1. I feel like I'm really working at a startup in every sense of the word. We'll talk about an idea one minute, and then in a  day its already being planned out detail by detail and executed. </p>
<p>2. The company has a culture of trust and responsibility. With that also comes very high expectations. When something is assigned to you, its expected to get done. Its on you to communicate if something comes up that changes your timeline. <b>Over-communication is key. </b>(I ran into an issue my first week that could have easily been resolved had I communicated better)</p>
<p>3. Self-confidence is essential at a startup. Similar to the above point, its on you to figure out a lot of things. Of course you have a team to rely on, but that team also has a lot on their plate as well.</p>
<p>4. Its very important for cofounders to play their strengths with their roles. For example, one co-founder focusing on   communications (with customers and partners) and the other being more tactical, focusing on day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>5. <b>Be a really good generalist.</b> I used to think my lack of focus was a bad thing, but I've learned to embrace it. Generalists thrive at early stage startups because every single day is different.</p>
<p>6. Its super important to start tracking business data as early as possible. Having data really helps with decision making and helping find which users to target for certain experiments.</p>
<p>7. Transparency is key. We have a Slack channel to highlight both conquers and botches. That way, its okay to mess up on things, and you can see that other people are human and make mistakes too.</p>
<p>8. I feel like I'm doing very impactful work. In my 2 weeks that I've been here, I've done more than I've done at entire internships. If you can move fast, they will keep throwing more at you. So many opportunities to learn :)</p> 
<p>9. You never know who you will learn from. You can find admirable traits in everyone you meet</p>
<p>10. We need more women representation in tech companies. Being at a women-run/majority women company is a great experience. I can't speak much overall since I only have a sample size of one but communication has been incredibly clear and there is a deep love and empathy for the customer. Overall, been having a great experience and excited for what's to come!</p>
