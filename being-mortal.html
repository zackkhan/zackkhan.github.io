          <p>My Nana (grandpa in Hindi) is living life. Even at age 76, he is still able to attend Friday prayers at the Mosque, go on walks, and is surrounded by his children and grandchildren. And perhaps most importantly, he is able to live in his own home. My family's role is to support my Nana so that he can live life on his own terms.</p>
          <p>Why can't all seniors live this kind of life? Before reading Atul Gawande's Being Mortal, I thought this lifestyle for seniors was ideal. The lives of seniors is a topic we tend to avoid discussing until we are forced to, and it certainly is not at the forefront of the minds of most 20 year olds. But it should be. The number of Americans over 65 will double by 2060 and will make up ~24% of our entire population. Before you know it, we'll be in that population as well.</p>
          <p>Thinking about senior life is not new to me. My mom works as an occupational therapist at a nursing home, and I have been volunteering at nursing homes since I was 11. From early on, I knew that something was wrong with how we treated seniors, especially in the United States, and it deeply upset me. But these past few months, I've been digging into why, and what the ideal scenario for senior life looks like.</p>
          <p>And it turns out, while my Nana's way of life is great, it's not scalable. My Nana's lifestyle was only manageable because many of his children have not left his home. But the historical pattern is clear: “as soon as people get their resources and opportunity to abandon that way of life, they are gone”.</p>
          <p>In contemporary society, we often do not see caring for seniors as a shared, multigenerational responsibility like my Nana, but instead, as a private state that largely involves doctors and institutions like nursing homes. But this is not inherently bad. Gawande argues that “modernization did not demote seniors. It demoted the family: It gave people - the young and the old - a way of life with more liberty and control, including the liberty to be less beholden on other generations”. The ideal scenario for modern society is seniors being able to live the lives they want, while still providing freedom to both generations.</p>
          <p>A huge appeal to college students is the idea of freedom. After years of curfews, we are finally free to live our lives and do what we want. But imagine after living most of your adult life this way, to return to the restricted lifestyle you had as a kid. But this time, the curfew is not set by your parents, but by your children, or by biology.</p>
          <p>According to Gawande, our biggest fear as we age is losing our way of life and the ability to do the things we love. This is something we can all relate to, as we have all lived life at some point with restrictions on what we enjoy doing. However, the problem for seniors is that the medical world is focused not on maintaining their way of life, but rather on prolonging their life. As a senior, your preferences and desires are often ignored.</p>
          <p>Medicine's primary goal is amelioration. When faced with a new decision, medicine tells us to go for a new treatment with the hopes of prolonging life. Medicine avoids having tougher discussions on the lives that seniors want to lead. While prolonging life sounds great, it often doesn't work out as planned. With every treatment, side effects often include compromising their standard of living and doing what they love. With every added procedure, there is the inevitable recovery period that can lead to seniors spending their last days on a hospital bed instead of in the home they love, surrounded by the people they love.</p>
          <p>On a more positive note, there are still many ways that seniors are living their final years to the fullest. What I personally found inspiring in “Being Mortal” were the stories of seniors continuing to find purpose in life during their final days. My favorite example was how Dr Bill Thomas brought animals to the Chase Memorial Home, which caused residents such as Mr.L, who had rarely spoken before, to come out of their shells. Residents took the dogs for walks and actively talked to others about how their birds were doing.</p>
          <p>Gawande also mentions living communities that allow seniors to maintain their lifestyles while still being cared for by caregivers. This provided a stark contrast from the traditional nursing home style that provide the utmost safety in exchange for days that blur together and a lack of consideration for what seniors want in life.</p>
          <p>I have spent a lot of time thinking about this book, thinking about my parents, my senior friends, and eventually how I would like to live life as I age. What I am most fearful of is losing purpose. As I am in the midst of figuring out what I want to do with my life, I can't help but feel like we've given up on people that have done so much for us and need our help the most.</p>
          <p>But I am an optimistic person, and as the senior population continues to grow, I am excited to see how we approach this continual struggle against our own biological clocks. I feel inspired to find ways to provide a purposeful life for seniors that fits into contemporary society. I hope more young people think about this inevitable problem as well, because unless you want to live in a nursing home, it's up to us to define our own purposeful futures.</p>
